## This site contains documentation of the various things I have happened to invest some time into investigating and decided to make documentation for
I believe that specific kind of knowledge in the right hands can do a lot of good things, so I decided to document things I know about. The things I know are very niche and I'd be shame if that information would happen to just dissapear one day.


I have decided to use 3kliksphilip's approach to tutorials, based on his old Hammer World Editor tutorial series. Raw simple knowledge that you can kickstart yourself from to do many things. As this knowledge is supposed to create a starting point for you, it is recommended to study more than just the documentation located on this site.



It is highly encouraged to fork and expand on the knowledge and information located on this site.
